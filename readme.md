# Real Estate Assistant Application

This application is designed to facilitate real estate transactions and inquiries, leveraging a Flask-based web service to interact with users for property searches, viewings, and more.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This application is tested with Python 3.8+.

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies for your application. Here's how to set it up on various operating systems:

#### For Windows:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS and Linux:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Set the necessary environment variables. You can use a `.env` file or export them directly into your environment. These typically include:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `RAPID_API_KEY`
- `WEBHOOK_URL`
- `CUSTOM_API_KEY`

### Core Functions

The application includes several core functions:

- **Property Search Assistance**: Facilitates searching for real estate listings based on user input.
- **Scheduling Property Viewings**: Allows users to schedule property viewings and handles the necessary arrangements.
- **Lead Capture and Management**: Captures and manages potential client information for follow-up and marketing purposes.

### Running the Application

```bash
flask run

This will start a local server, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
